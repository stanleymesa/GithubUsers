## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanleymesa/GithubUsers.git
cd GithubUsers
```

### 2. Create a GitHub API Token

The app requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to make API calls. You can generate one by following these steps:

* Go to your GitHub account **Settings**.

* Navigate to **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.

* Click **Generate new token**.

* Give it a name (e.g., "Github Users App Token") and set the expiration.

* The token does not require any specific scopes.

* **Copy the generated token.** You will only be able to see it once.

### 3. Add the Token to `local.properties`

* In the root directory of the project, create a file named `local.properties`.

* Add the following line to the file, replacing `ghp_your_token` with the token you copied:
`github.api.token=ghp_your_token`

### 4. Sync and Run*

* Open the project in Android Studio.

* Let Gradle sync all dependencies.

* Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
